          A clip from a certain popular influencer was doing the rounds on social media recently.

I think I missed the bus when BRs became the be all, end all game mode of FPS. I could probably write an entire article on the flaws and failings of the genre, so for now, I&rsquo;ll just say that not every FPS release needs to have a battle royale gamemode.
This doesn&rsquo;t have to be a zero-sum game.

            MMOs in 2021?

          I think the last time I&rsquo;d played an MMO was somewhere around 2008. Before that, however, MMOs were a huge part of my gaming life growing up. Runescape (or what is known today as &ldquo;Old School Runescape&rdquo;) was my first MMO and also the first online game I ever played, and it was so long ago that it ran as a Java applet (remember those?) in your web browser. It was technically simple enough that it ran on the hand-me-down IBM Thinkpad I was using at the time, and it was full of features that were completely new to me.

          For a long time, I never felt like I had anything to blog about. I never thought I had anything interesting or useful to put out there. I work as a programmer, but I&rsquo;ve never really been interested in writing that type of content. I think I don&rsquo;t want to produce tutorials or help articles because I don&rsquo;t really consume that kind of content myself. They go out of date, are sometimes poorly written or even factually inaccurate, and I just don&rsquo;t find them worth the hassle when I could read official documentation or a well-edited book instead.
