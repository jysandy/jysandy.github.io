    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I think the last time I&rsquo;d played an MMO was somewhere around 2008. Before that, however, MMOs were a huge part of my gaming
life growing up. Runescape (or what is known today as &ldquo;Old School Runescape&rdquo;) was my first MMO and also the first online
game I ever played, and it was so long ago that it ran as a Java applet (remember those?) in your web browser. It was
technically simple enough that it ran on the hand-me-down IBM Thinkpad I was using at the time, and it was full of features
that were completely new to me. There was a <a href="https://runescape.wiki/images/1/10/RuneScape_Worldmap.png?f5d00">huge world</a>
to explore, many <a href="https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Skills">skills</a> to train as a means of developing one&rsquo;s character and
a number of &ldquo;quests&rdquo; or missions that were engaging and tied into the worldbuilding and other mechanics of the game. It was
also the first time I&rsquo;d played in a world that was so populated with other players(a defining feature of MMOs, of course)
and experienced the systems that arose as a result (such as an economy). I put a lot of time into the game with my friends,
but since I was playing the free-to-play version, most of the content was unavailable to me. Eventually, I moved on to
MapleStory.</p>
<p>MapleStory was a Korean, 2D, side-scrolling MMORPG. Graphically and gameplay-wise, that made it very different from Runescape.
I quickly warmed up to the side-scrolling nature of the game and the goofy, colourful world, but I was disappointed by the
lack of a skill system like Runescape and by the uninteresting quests. This was my introduction to what are now known as
&ldquo;fetch quests&rdquo;, or quests wherein the objective is simply &ldquo;go to location X and kill Y number of Z monster&rdquo;, or to simply
collect a certain number of items and hand them in. They seemed so lazy and boring compared to (what I saw as) the more
handcrafted experience of Runescape&rsquo;s quests. Still, I had fun with the game for a bit. Eventually, I realized that those
who spent money on in-game items had a sizeable advantage over those who didn&rsquo;t (these are known today as &ldquo;pay-to-win&rdquo;
mechanics, and are apparently widespread in mobile games nowadays). This was also around the time that games such as
<a href="https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a> were starting to become popular, and MMOs in general were declining
in popularity. MapleStory was the last MMO game that I played for a while, and I moved on to multiplayer games that weren&rsquo;t
MMOs such as LoL and Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>A few MMOs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online">ESO</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV">FFXIV</a>
came out in between then and now, but I never got to play them at launch for one reason or another. I&rsquo;d stopped playing MMOs
altogether until recently, when Amazon&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/playnewworld">New World</a> released. When I played the
New World open beta on September 9th though, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d pick up and enjoy the game on release.</p>
<p>There were things that I immediately took a liking to, such as the more mechanical and action-oriented combat. In recent
years, I&rsquo;ve found myself wanting games to be mechanically interesting and demanding (which is part of the reason I don&rsquo;t
play MOBAs anymore), so I was happy to see this. Everything else, however, seemed to fall short of my previous MMO
experiences. The quests were lazy fetch quests that didn&rsquo;t even make me want to pay attention to the worldbuilding. I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ve read or listened to a single dialogue in this game without skipping it. The world design and variety of Runescape
and MS was lacking here, too. The world just seemed to be plains and forests with a handful of towns in between. The
enemies appeared to be recoloured versions of the same zombie or skeleton. Contrast this with Runescape&rsquo;s Varrock which is
a bustling city filled with life and things to do, or with Maplestory&rsquo;s Victoria Island, which includes plains, a forest,
a desert and an urban area (and that&rsquo;s not even half of the entire world map). To this day, I still listen to the soundtracks
of Runescape and Maplestory when I work, but the New World soundtrack was so forgettable, I don&rsquo;t even think I could describe it.
Eventually I just turned it off and played my own music. The game wasn&rsquo;t even good on the technical front. It was full of bugs,
would drop below 40 FPS at times and didn&rsquo;t have SEA servers on launch. Suffice it to say that I got burnt out of the game
pretty quickly. I did buy the game sometime after launch, but I played it for a weekend or two and haven&rsquo;t touched it since.</p>
<p>And yet, the game&rsquo;s still attracting <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1063730">over 500k concurrent players</a> concurrent players
at peak. Why are people still interested in this?</p>
<p>One explanation is that this is the first MMO that many younger gamers have played. MMOs haven&rsquo;t been popular in the public
eye for several years now, so to these newer players, New World must seem completely novel. I myself know a number of people who&rsquo;ve
never played an MMO before. Aside from this, however — I&rsquo;m out of ideas. At some point, I&rsquo;ll write about my lack of understanding
of the typical gamer&rsquo;s wants, because they&rsquo;re a complete mystery to me. As for myself, I think it&rsquo;s likely that my own tastes
in gaming have changed quite a bit over time. I can&rsquo;t help but see banal and repetitive gameplay for what it is now, and this
is probably why I primarily play PvP-focused games. Even in New World, the most fun I had with the game were the PvP elements;
but those are gated behind a wall of drudgery and fetch quests as well. I played some <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft">WoW</a> recently
after a friend suggested it. I only played for about an hour, and I plan on trying the game out for longer, but so far, the
tutorial has just been more fetch quests and a lot of coddling and handholding, with admittedly some novelty in the world
design. I&rsquo;ll see if it holds my interest for long,er but if not, maybe I just can&rsquo;t enjoy MMOs anymore.</p>
