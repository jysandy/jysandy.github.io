<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MintBlitz/status/1452794539668693000">https://twitter.com/MintBlitz/status/1452794539668693000</a></p>
<p>I think I missed the bus when BRs became the be all, end all game mode of FPS. I could probably write an
entire article on the flaws and failings of the genre, so for now, I&rsquo;ll just say that not every FPS release needs to have
a battle royale gamemode.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have to be a zero-sum game. Players who like the BR game mode can choose from any number of popular titles
today. Players who don&rsquo;t like it should have the option to play other games or game modes. Over the years, however, I&rsquo;ve
seen the industry chase trends constantly and beat dead horses into a pulp. In the last five years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battle_royale_games">almost every high-profile
FPS release from a AAA developer has been a battle royale</a>. We&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/1047-games-raises-100m-on-the-runaway-success-of-its-debut-title-splitgate/#:~:text=Proulx%20said%20investors%20shut%20the%20door%20on%20him%20repeatedly%20because%20they%20didn%E2%80%99t%20see%20Splitgate%20competing%20in%20any%20of%20the%20popular%20genres%2C%20battle%20royales%20and%20hero%20shooters%2C%20for%20instance.">investors are unwilling to fund
anything else</a>.
Ironically, most of these games have been flashes in the pan, leaving aside the mobile titles.</p>
<p>This mindless trendchasing has to stop. I remember when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlerite">Battlerite Royale</a> was
released, it was seen by most people as a desperate attempt to save the dwindling playerbase rather than anything thoughtful
and creative. Others, like <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/spellbreak">Spellbreak</a>, had fun and novel game mechanics, but they didn&rsquo;t seem well
suited to the BR game mode to me. It would behoove developers, publishers and investors to think more deeply about why
these games failed from a design and mechanical standpoint rather than to just jump on the bandwagon and add to the body
count. The most successful PC BR releases (Apex Legends and COD Warzone) actually addressed previous issues with the genre
rather than copy-pasting what had already been done before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also becoming increasingly difficult to compete with the top BR games of today. At the time of writing, Apex Legends has:</p>
<ul>
<li>four BR maps,</li>
<li>nineteen playable characters,</li>
<li>two game modes (BR and arenas),</li>
<li>ranked playlists for both BR and arenas, and</li>
<li>an experienced dev team and an invested playerbase built up over the course of four years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully it isn&rsquo;t hard to see why an invested Apex player wouldn&rsquo;t play a new BR game that has few to none of these features.
A Halo BR in particular seems like it would just be a worse version of Apex Legends. There are some differences, but by and large
the weapons and gunplay aren&rsquo;t too different. The main differentiating factor of Halo is the arena-style gameplay. Take that away
and you&rsquo;re left with an Apex-like game without all the content.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems like the bodies of dead BRs have piled up high enough that developers are trying different things. This
past year has seen the announcement or release of many FPS games that aren&rsquo;t BRs. Battlefield 2042 has just released and Spligate
has had a successful beta. Halo Infinite is highly anticipated and will release in December, and Ubisoft have announced some strange
things such as Tom Clancy&rsquo;s XD (lol). I&rsquo;m happy that FPS isn&rsquo;t synonymous with BR anymore, and we finally have options for everyone
who isn&rsquo;t caught up in the craze.</p>
