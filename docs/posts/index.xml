      <description>For a long time, I never felt like I had anything to blog about. I never thought I had anything interesting or useful to put out there. I work as a programmer, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been interested in writing that type of content. I think I don&amp;rsquo;t want to produce tutorials or help articles because I don&amp;rsquo;t really consume that kind of content myself. They go out of date, are sometimes poorly written or even factually inaccurate, and I just don&amp;rsquo;t find them worth the hassle when I could read official documentation or a well-edited book instead.</description>
