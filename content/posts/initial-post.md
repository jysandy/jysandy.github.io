For a long time, I never felt like I had anything to blog about. I never thought I had anything interesting or useful 
to put out there. I work as a programmer, but I've never really been interested in writing that type of content. I think I 
don't want to produce tutorials or help articles because I don't really consume that kind of content myself. They go out of 
date, are sometimes poorly written or even factually inaccurate, and I just don't find them worth the hassle when I could 
read official documentation or a well-edited book instead. Creating help articles whose quality I'm satisfied with seems 
like it would take a lot of time and energy that I'm not willing to expend. Experience reports are a possibility, but what 
would I write about? I don't program in my spare time, and writing about what I build at work just seems like a can of 
worms. There's always the conflicting interest of marketing for my employer/client, and I think that might make it 
difficult for me to produce something authentic. And don't even get me started on the opinion pieces, hot takes and advice 
articles. It seems like this field is full of people who want to tell you what your career should look like, what not to do, 
or that X is wrong and Y is right. I understand that this is part of how communication around nuanced topics works, but 
every time I see one of these articles, there's part of me that just wants to groan. This general category of discussion just seems like a 
black hole, an endless void that absorbs all resources thrown at it without producing anything of import. 

I think there's a weird, below-the-surface expectation in the programming community that if one starts a blog, they must 
blog about programming-related topics (are you even a Haskell programmer if you haven't written a [monad tutorial](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad_tutorials_timeline)?). Recently 
though, it dawned on me that I don't need to follow these rules. I don't have to write how-tos or profound opinion pieces 
if I don't want to. I can write about whatever I want, however I want, and that's precisely what I intend to do. 

I'm not necessarily trying to be provocative, but there are people who might feel attacked by some of what I 
just wrote. Some might find it judgemental, clouded or irrational. Some might find it self-contradictory, and I might even 
say one thing in a blog post and say/do the opposite in a later post. And that's okay. Self-expression is the primary goal of 
my blog, and this means that objectivity, dispassion and rational critique may have to take a back seat from time to time. 
Authenticity is non-negotiable to me when it comes to self-expression, and this means that my posts will have some amount 
of spontaneity and emotion. I've made peace with the fact that some people will dislike my posts/myself/my (somewhat lossy) 
projection of my thoughts and feelings, no matter what. If you'd like an objective and rational take, the rest of the Internet 
is [over there](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/welcome-to-the-internet). Good luck sifting through that mess.

As for topics or subject matter, my blogs will probably be mostly gaming related, since I don't have much of a space to 
discuss that anywhere else. There might be a handful of non-gaming posts sprinkled in here and there. Maybe about lifestyle, 
social/cultural/political topics, and maybe even about programming (this isn't supposed to be rational, remember?). But right 
now, [New World](https://twitter.com/playnewworld)'s (seemingly) staggering popularity despite what I perceive to be obvious, 
glaring flaws is something that interests me. Expect an article about that in the near future.
