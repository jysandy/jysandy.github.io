                This is a novel volumetric rendering technique that doesn't use ray-marching, voxels or temporal
                blending. The volumetric particles are represented by tetrahedrons which are converted to triangle
                proxies using a mesh shader. This project forms my master's dissertation, and is still under active
                development.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This method builds on the work of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbMGtfMei10">Thibault
                        Tricard's Interval Shading</a> to draw volumetric particles as tetrahedrons that are composed of
                    participating media.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Interval Shading uses mesh shaders to splat tetrahedrons to the screen as triangle proxies. Vertex
                    attributes are set in such a way that after rasterization, the pixel shader receives two depths: one
                    for the front face of the tetrahedron and one for the back. This depth interval can then be used for
                    shading.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Since the medium is represented by a rasterized particle system instead of a density field or
                    voxels, it is easy to animate and can be used for interactive simulations, as demonstrated in the
                    video.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Radiance is integrated for a single tetrahedron using the depth interval provided by interval
                    shading. The tetrahedrons are sorted on the GPU and drawn furthest-to-nearest and blending is used
                    to integrate radiance across all particles.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Self shadowing is achieved by first rendering optical thickness into a light-space 3D texture
                    similar to
                    conventional shadow maps. To determine the optical thickness along the light ray at any point along
                    a depth interval, this 3D texture is sampled at both interval boundaries and linearly interpolated.
                </li>

                <li>
                    To make the tetrahedron edges less visible, extinction is exponentially faded with distance from the
                    particle centre. Solving the resulting integral analytically is impractical, so Simpson's rule is
                    used to integrate radiance across a depth interval instead. Only one additional sample in the middle
                    of the depth interval is used.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Some of the planned future work includes:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Shadowing of the medium by opaque objects.</li>
                        <li>Casting volumetric shadows onto opaque objects.</li>
                        <li>
                            Performance optimizations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Draw to a lower resolution to reduce pixel shader cost, then upscale and composite.
                                </li>
                                <li>Frustum culling when drawing the volumetric shadow map.</li>
                                <li>Early-Z culling does not work with this method. Therefore, occlusion culling has to
                                    be performed in the mesh shader.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                Gradient is a game engine written in C++ and DirectX 12. It uses forward rendering with a Z-prepass.
                The scene has 9.7 million leaves which are individually instanced, culled and animated on the GPU using
                a mesh shader. Some other major features are physics simulation and a first-person character controller

                            time, I used a cheap approximation instead.
                            To compute indirect lighting, the reflected view vector is used to sample the sky dome. A
                            flat ambient term is added to this value and the result is fed to the BRDF. This step is
                            repeated by sampling the sky dome using the surface normal and the two results are combined.

                CitruSpire: Quest for the Sacred Fruit is a short 2.5D action platformer game made in Unreal Engine 5.4.
                I worked with a team of second year undergraduate students to build this as a part of my

                I was responsible for programming most of the core systems of the game, including character movement and

        I've worked professionally as a software engineer for around 7 years. Almost all of that time was spent at
        <a href="https://nilenso.com/">nilenso</a>, an employee-owned software consultancy. I worked with clients to
        build complex and scalable backend services. I also played the role of a hiring manager at nilenso and have
        mentored and trained junior engineers.

        I helped clients and teams build better products, both by delivering software to a high standard myself and by
        coaching and advising teams that I worked with. These are some of the clients whom I've worked with:

                    Gojek is an on-demand decacorn in Southeast Asia. I worked on multiple mission-critical systems,
                    including their ride-hailing platform, the A/B testing system, a payment processing system and many
                    others.

                    <li>
                        I built a fault-tolerant payment processing system for the ride-hailing product, in a team of 3
                        engineers. The system was
                        designed to be eventually consistent. It automatically retried failed payments, and had controls
                        for manual intervention as a fallback or in the event of a serious outage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As a part of the on-call rotation, I responded to and debugged production outages and customer
                        support tickets. I wrote root-cause analyses for any outages that occured while I was on

                        I built a configurable, rule-based traffic segmentation system for the company’s main A/B
                        testing platform.

                                Traffic was routed into one of two variants: the treatment group or control group. Each
                                group could be assigned a percentage of traffic.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Changing the traffic percentage assignment later results in a minimal number of
                                customers moving from one variant to another, so as to retain stickiness of sessions and
                                minimise disruption.

                        I trained and mentored a team of 6 developers in the Clojure programming language, and worked
                        with them to build and ship a new microservice written in Clojure.
